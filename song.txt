Hardwired


ln the name of desperation


ln the name of wretched pain


ln the name of all creation


Gone insane


We're so fucked


Shit outta luck


Hardwired to self-destruct


On the way to paranoia


On the crooked borderline


On the way to great destroyer


Doom design


We're so fucked


Shit outta luck


Hardwired to self-destruct


Once upon a planet burning

Once upon a flame

Once upon a fear returning

All in vain

Do you feel that hope is fading?

Do you comprehend?

Do you feel it terminating?

ln the end


We're so fucked


Shit outta luck


Hardwired to self-destruct


Hardwired to self-destruct


Self-destruct


Self-destruct


Self-destruct
